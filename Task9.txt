During this 1:st assignment i mainly learnt about the C++ string class and and how much easier it
was to work with strings than C. I've had a course in C-programming prior to this, so i was quite familiar
with the syntax and code structure.

I found task 6 to be the one that a spent most time on, mainly because such a long time since i've worked with prime numbers.
But a couple of google searches, looking in the C++ reference page and some trail and error i finally got it working.

So as first assignment i found it adequate, providing some challange and head-scratching without being so difficult that
could't even imagine where to start.
